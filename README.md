# Product-of-two-large-numbers

The function in this program returns the product of two large (or small) numbers.

This isn't really required in python as product of any number of any size could be computed as long as the result stays within the memory limit
But this was just for practice's sake, and same algorithm could be implemented in c / c++ or any other language.
